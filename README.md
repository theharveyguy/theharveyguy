# Hello there,
<!---
General Kenobi!

:wave: My name is Michael Harvey, but my friends call me Harv. I studied Computer Science in college and used GitHub to keep track of some of my later projects, you can still find those archived repos here if you want to check those out. I graduated college at the end of 2019 and shortly after that I worked as a technical specialist for an Army Childcare facility. While I was there, I had a blast showing kids how cool computers and other pieces of tech could be, as well as sharing the importance of having a healthy relationship with the technologies we use. I am currently working as an Audio/Video Technician for Auburn University, which if you happen to be an Auburn student taking online classes, you've probably seen some of my work.

✝️ But talking about computers will not give you the full picture of me. I am a Christian and I love the Bible. My true passion in life is to teach students the truth of scripture, building a foundation that prepares them for the complexities of our world today. I've served in many different capacities with several different churches over the years, and I've been fascinated with how new technologies can be leveraged for the sake of the Gospel.

## Current projects

📑I publish my writings on my blog, theharveyguy.com. I like writing about the Bible, Ministry, and a little bit of tech here and there.
